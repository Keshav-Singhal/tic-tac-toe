Hi, This is my 1st project using React. I followed the tutorial provided at the official React Website: https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe

To run this project:

- Download an archive of the files locally
  
- Unzip the archive, then open a terminal and cd to the directory you unzipped
  
- Install the dependencies with "npm install"
  
- Run "npm start" to start a local server and follow the prompts to view the code running in a browser

Thank You
Keshav Singhal
